Abstract:
Navigating through an airport is easy enough for most passengers, but when you are reduced in
mobility it is a different story. We want to find a schedule for the airportâ€™s employees to support
as many of those passengers as possible while ensuring a smooth journey with little waiting time.
In addition we want to find a robust schedule to handle minor disturbances which we test using
a simulation at the end. We present a decomposition model in which we first determine feasible
start times for the tasks describing the journeys of the passengers using Simulated Annealing, after
which in each iteration we assign the tasks to the employees in the next phase using a matching
algorithm or heuristic.
